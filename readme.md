Battle of Nation

Turn-Based Clicker Game

Description

This is a simple turn-based clicker game, where the player selects a country, each with its own unique units. The game follows a battle system where both the player and the computer take turns attacking. The turn order is randomized at the beginning of each battle round.

Each unit has a special ability, which can provide a one-time bonus. Once used, the ability cannot be activated again.

This is a purely browser-based game, built using:

Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)

Pure CSS (for styling)

HTML (for structure)

Features
